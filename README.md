Final Project for UW DATA 512

## Abstract

Throughout history, music has consistently been used as one of the cultural indicators of society, in addition to literature, art, and film. I would like to analyze the Billboard charts from the 60s until today, and find patterns in listening patterns, song preferences, and most importantly, genre changes. This type of analysis would be interesting to historians, ethnographers, anthropologists, music enthusiasts, and even music managers, since it provides a data-driven approach to understanding how music popularity evolves as society evolves, and vice versa.
