# A4: Final Project Proposal

## Motivation & Problem statement

Earlier this month, while browsing YouTube top 10 trending, I saw at least 5 of the videos on that list being hip hop music videos. It seems like hip hop has transformed from being a niche genre in the 80s and 90s to complete mainstream today. I did some research, and read this [Time's piece](https://time.com/5118041/rap-music-mainstream/) on exactly that. From the article:

> Nearly half of the songs on Jan. 27â€™s Billboard Hot 100 chart were rap or incorporate elements of hip-hop.

Throughout history, music has consistently been used as one of the cultural indicators of society, in addition to literature, art, and film. I would like to analyze the Billboard charts from the 60s until today, and find patterns in listening patterns, song preferences, and most importantly, genre changes. This type of analysis would be interesting to historians, ethnographers, anthropologists, and music enthusiasts, since it provides a data-driven approach to understanding how music evolves as society evolves, and vice versa.

I hope to learn the following:

* new data analysis methods
* insights about the evolution of music from the 60s to present day
* new music for my spotify playlist

## Dataset

The dataset I plan to use is the [Billboard Hot Weekly Charts](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017). This dataset has the following columns:

| Columns |
|---------|
| url |
| weekid |
| week_position |
| song |
| performer |
| songid|
| instance |
| previous_week_position |
| peak_position |
| weeks_on_chart |

As a stretch goal, I plan to combine the billboard dataset above with [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) in order to find correlation between songs that are in the Billboard Hot Weekly Charts and their respective music videos in YouTube trending.

| Columns |
|---------|
| video_id|
| trending_date|
| title|
| channel_title|
| category_id|
| publish_time|
| tags|
| views|

## Unknowns & dependencies

If the datasets are taken down by the author due to licensing issues, it may prevent me from continuing analysis on the dataset.
