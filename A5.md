# A5: Final Project Plan

DATA 512 (Human-Centered Data Science)

## Introduction

Earlier this month, while browsing YouTube top 10 trending, I saw at least 5 of the videos on that list being hip hop music videos. It seems like hip hop has transformed from being a niche genre in the 80s and 90s to complete mainstream today. I did some research, and read this [Time's piece](https://time.com/5118041/rap-music-mainstream/) on exactly that. From the article:

> Nearly half of the songs on Jan. 27’s Billboard Hot 100 chart were rap or incorporate elements of hip-hop.

Throughout history, music has consistently been used as one of the cultural indicators of society, in addition to literature, art, and film. I would like to analyze the Billboard charts from the 60s until today, and find patterns in listening patterns, song preferences, and most importantly, genre changes. This type of analysis would be interesting to historians, ethnographers, anthropologists, and music enthusiasts, since it provides a data-driven approach to understanding how music evolves as society evolves, and vice versa.

## Data

The dataset I plan to use is the [Billboard Hot Weekly Charts](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017). This dataset has the following columns:

| Columns |
|---------|
| url |
| weekid |
| week_position |
| song |
| performer |
| songid|
| instance |
| previous_week_position |
| peak_position |
| weeks_on_chart |

Size: 42.28 MB

As a stretch goal, I plan to combine the billboard dataset above with [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) in order to find correlation between songs that are in the Billboard Hot Weekly Charts and their respective music videos in YouTube trending.

| Columns |
|---------|
| video_id|
| trending_date|
| title|
| channel_title|
| category_id|
| publish_time|

### Potential Data Limitations

If the datasets are taken down by the author due to licensing issues, it may prevent me from continuing analysis on the dataset.

## Research Questions

The Billboard Weekly Charts, YouTube trending music video, and Genius data provide insights by themselves, but also when combined together. Below are some of the analyses I hope to conduct in this project, and research questions I hope to get quantitative answers to.

### Popularity Trends

* How does the popularity of songs change over weeks?
* How does the popularity of songs change over months?
* How does the popularity of songs change over years?
* How does the popularity of hip-hop artists change over time?
* How have the popularity of song genres changed over time?

### Correlation between Music Videos and Song Popularity

* Is there correlation between trending music video of a song and the popularity of that song?

### Correlation between Genius Data and Song Popularity

Music Producers and Managers will be interested in seeing the correlation between how popular a music video is, and how well the song performs in the Billboard 100.

## Tools

I plan to use Python with the `pandas` and `numpy` package for analyzing data, and `matplotlib` for visualizing data. If the data size is too big, I may use `pyspark` to do some data processing and ETL before moving to analyzing. I plan to produce a Jupyter Notebook to document each step of the research process.

The Jupyter notebook will contain code that is reproducible, even if only done on a subset of the dataset.

## Motivation & Problem statement

This type of analysis would be interesting to historians, ethnographers, anthropologists, and music enthusiasts, since it provides a data-driven approach to understanding how music evolves as society evolves, and vice versa.

I hope to learn the following:

* new data analysis methods
* insights about the evolution of music from the 60s to present day
* new music for my spotify playlist
