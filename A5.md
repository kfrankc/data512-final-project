## Introduction

Earlier this month, while browsing YouTube top 10 trending, I saw at least 5 of the videos on that list being hip hop music videos. It seems like hip hop has transformed from being a niche genre in the 80s and 90s to complete mainstream today. I did some research, and read this [Time's piece](https://time.com/5118041/rap-music-mainstream/)[1] on exactly that. From the article:

> Nearly half of the songs on Jan. 27â€™s Billboard Hot 100 chart were rap or incorporate elements of hip-hop.

Throughout history, music has consistently been used as one of the cultural indicators of society, in addition to literature, art, and film. I would like to analyze the Billboard charts from the 60s until today, and find patterns in listening patterns, song preferences, and most importantly, genre changes. This type of analysis would be interesting to historians, ethnographers, anthropologists, music enthusiasts, and even music managers, since it provides a data-driven approach to understanding how music popularity evolves as society evolves, and vice versa.

## Data

The dataset I plan to use consists of 3 parts:

* [**Billboard Hot Weekly Charts**](https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017): This dataset contains every weekly Hot 100 singles chart from Billboard.com. Each row of data represents a song and the corresponding position on that week's chart.
* [**Trending YouTube Video Statistics**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new): This dataset includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos.

Both datasets are labeled as public domain data. More details about CC0 licenses can be found [here](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)[2].

Specifics of both datasets can be found below:

### Billboard Hot Weekly Charts

The Billboard Hot Weekly Charts dataset represents every Billboard Hot Weekly Charts songs between August 2, 1958 and June 22, 2019.

The data can be downloaded in CSV format. There are 317795 rows and 10 columns.

This dataset has the following columns:

| Columns | DataType | Description |
|---------| ---------| ----------- |
| url | text | Billboard Chart URL |
| weekid | text | WeekID |
| week_position | text | Current week on chart |
| song | text | Song name |
| performer | text | Performer name |
| songid | text | SongID - Concatenation of song & performer |
| instance | text | Instance (this is used to separate breaks on the chart for a given song. Example, an instance of 6 tells you that this is the sixth time this song has appeared on the chart) |
| previous_week_position | text | Previous week position |
| peak_position | text | Peak Position (as of the corresponding week) |
| weeks_on_chart | text | Weeks on Chart (as of the corresponding week) |

### Trending YouTube Video Statistics

I plan to combine the Billboard dataset above with [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) in order to find correlation between songs that are in the Billboard Hot Weekly Charts and their respective music videos in YouTube trending in the US region. There are also other regions offered in the dataset, but I will focus on the US region first.

The data can be downloaded in CSV format. There are 655184 rows and 16 columns.

| Columns | DataType | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| video_id| text | ID of video |
| trending_date| datetime | Date of the trending video |
| title| text | title of the video  |
| channel_title| text | title of YouTube channel |
| category_id| text | ID of the category |
| publish_time| datetime | Time that video was published |
| tags| text | Video tags |
| views| text | YouTube video views |
| likes| text | Likes on the YouTube video |

### Potential Data Limitations

So far, I have uncovered 2 potential data limitations:

* If the datasets are taken down by the author due to licensing issues, it may prevent me from continuing analysis on the dataset.
* There are no good ways to extract genre from the Billboard songs. One potential method is to join the songs with a Wikipedia dataset that can map the songs to the artists, who are usually accompanied by a musical genre.

## Research Questions

The Billboard Weekly Charts, YouTube trending music video, and Genius data provide insights by themselves, but also when combined together. Below are some of the analyses I hope to conduct in this project, and research questions I hope to get quantitative answers to.

### Popularity Trends

* How does the popularity of songs change over weeks?
* How does the popularity of songs change over months?
* How does the popularity of songs change over years?
* How does the popularity of hip-hop artists change over time?
* How have the popularity of song genres changed over time?

### Correlation between Music Videos and Song Popularity

[Music videos are more important than ever in our culture](https://medium.com/@pulsefilms/why-music-videos-are-still-so-important-views-from-inside-the-industry-ebaa7d4758d2)[3]. It seems like many popular songs have an associated music video that racks up millions of views on YouTube. Specifically, I'd like to answer the following question:

* Is there correlation between trending music video of a song and the popularity of that song?

These questions are the starting points for me to explore the data and work towards some set goals as I continue this project.

Music Producers and Managers will be interested in seeing the correlation between how popular a music video is, and how well the song performs in the Billboard 100.

## Tools

I plan to use Python with the `pandas` and `numpy` package for analyzing data, and `matplotlib` for visualizing data. If the data size is too big, I may use `pyspark` to do some data processing and ETL before moving to analyzing. I plan to produce a Jupyter Notebook to document each step of the research process.

The Jupyter notebook will contain code that is reproducible, even if only done on a subset of the dataset.

## Unknowns & dependencies

If the datasets are taken down by the author due to licensing issues, it may prevent me from continuing analysis on the dataset.
